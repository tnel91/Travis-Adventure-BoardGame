## **_Description_**

The goal of this project is to create a a simple browser based board game similar to CandyLand. It will be built for two players and feature a linear path through the game. Players will be able to name their characters, and the game will track basic player-stats, such as health and held items. A player wins when they reach the end of the path.

Movement will be determined by dice roll, and events will be triggered by players landing on certain spaces. These events can be beneficial or a hinderance to the player. Events will play out in a text based format.

### **_Potential board space ideas_**

- **Monster Encounter**
  - The player can choose which weapon they want to attack with.
  - Upon defeat, the player will receive a reward, such as a new weapon, potion, or gold.
  - If a player reaches zero health, they are defeated and must respawn.
  - Certain monsters may be weak to certain items, i.e., a holy sword may do double damage to undead, or a bundle of garlic may make a vampire flee from a fight.
- **Respawn Space**
  - If a player's health reaches zero, they will move backwards to the respawn space they most recently passed.
  - If they have not passed a respawn point, the player moves back to start.
- **Shops**
  - If a player lands on a shop space, they will have the opportunity to spend earned gold.
  - Players may purchace things such as weapons, potions, extra dice rolls, or items that can interact with certain spaces.
- **Environmental Hazards**
  - May impact player movement or stats when landing on these spaces.
    - **_Poisonous Bog_**: Skips players next turn.
    - **_Mysterious Portal_**: Randomly moves player forwards _or_ backwards on the board.
    - **_Misty Woods_**: Cuts player movement in half on their next turn.
    - **_Bridge Troll_**: Pay the troll gold or prepare to fight!
